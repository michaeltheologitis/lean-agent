Define a positive integer $n$ to be \emph{squarish} if either $n$ is itself a perfect square or the distance from $n$ to the nearest perfect square is a perfect square. For example, $2016$ is squarish, because the nearest perfect square to $2016$ is $45^2 = 2025$ and $2025 - 2016 = 9$ is a perfect square. (Of the positive integers between $1$ and $10$, only $6$ and $7$ are not squarish.)

For a positive integer $N$, let $S(N)$ be the number of squarish integers between $1$ and $N$,
inclusive. Find positive constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that
\[
\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{S(N)}{N^\alpha} = \beta,
\]
or show that no such constants exist.
